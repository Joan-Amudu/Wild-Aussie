## About  

This is a site where I can post places that I am going to so that friends can see and join. so if I am going hiking in the loo mountains, I can post this on the site severals days in advance to tell people/friends what I intend on during, like hiking the giant start way on Saturday. I will also give details of how I will go to the said location. I can also post pics before (maybe from the internet or from previous similar activity) and after(pictures taken on the actual day). I can also share tips of what to wear, how tough or easy the hike was, weather and also other interesting things like where to what other walks/hikes or fun things to do in that area. Other people can also comment and share their experiences and also tips/recommendations for other fun places to go to and activities to do (so a blog site for others who share their own experiences within Australia)

### Future / further development features -- by Joan Amudu
* I would have liked to implement a bot or AI system that filters out inappropriate information without the admin having to constantly monitor and reject such information
* A bot/chat function to help with basic issues like passowrd reset, lost username and passowrd, so that these tasks are done and fullfilled immediately
